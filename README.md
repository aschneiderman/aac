# BJS Postcards

Playful Coding is a proof of concept source experiment to show how we could teach beginning programming where 

- We take advantage of the fun, cool stuff tech can do today
- The course and its libraries are open source, so teachers can remix it to fit their students and their teachng style

Playful Coding is based on a mildly simplified library built on top of [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/).

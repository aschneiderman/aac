# BJS Postcards

Postcards is an Open source experiment to see if we can teach beginning  coding by creating digital "postcards" using some of the cool things you can do with [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/).

NOTE: this site isn't yet ready for public use -- right now it's just a place to experiment.

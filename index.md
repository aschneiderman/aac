*NOTE: this site isn't yet ready for public use -- right now it's just a place to experiment*

I'm using this site as a place to experiment with:
- Teaching creative data visualization to data analysts  and Excel power users who aren't coders -- currently with either p5.js or BabylonJS
- Teaching intro to coding using fun, flashy stuff using an open source library, so teachers could monkey around with them (unlike, e.g., the fabulous code.org)

More on what I'm up to once I've had more time to experiment and have a better idea of what's easy versus hard to do.

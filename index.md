*NOTE: this site isn't yet ready for public use -- right now it's just a place to experiment*

These days, computers and phones can do a lot of cool stuff, but a lot of intro to coding classes still look like it's 1970.

There are some sites, like code.org, that take full advantage of the cool things you can do today. But unfortunately, these courses are designed
so that only a handful of developers can modify them.

BJS Postcards is an Open source experiment to see if we can teach beginning  coding by creating digital "postcards" using some of the cool things you can do with [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/). 

Let's [Get Started](./lessons/)!

#### More About BJS Postcards
- [About](./about/) page
- { Brief desciption of ideas behind the project:
  - learn by exploring (vsas much syntax as quickly as possible)
  - Reduce cofnitive load by hiding complexity of BabylonJS -- but structure it so students know this is simplified
  - Design so more like a playlist -- try to make it easier for teachers to customize for their unique situation w/o hav(ingto reinvent everyhting from scratch
  - Eventually, design so could generate versions to be taught online -- eg, make it easy to build in GitHub and push new/updated lessons to [Glitch](https://glitch.com) -- or offline if little Net access
  - Design for Student audience: high school, young adults, adults, organization's staff
  - Possible followup project: creative data viz  }

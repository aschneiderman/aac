These days, computers and phones can do a lot of cool stuff, but a lot of intro to coding classes still look like it's 1970.

There are some sites, like code.org, that take full advantage of the cool things you can do today. But unfortunately, these courses are designed
so that only a handful of developers can modify them.

Postcards is an Open source experiment to see if we can teach beginning  coding by creating digital "postcards" using some of the cool things you can do with [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/), an open source JavaScript 3D engine. BabylonJS is really powerful, but because it is so powerful it's also a bit overwhelming to get started. So Postcards uses libraries to hide a lot of the geekier stuff, so students can focus on learning the basics of computer programming.

Let's [Get Started](pages/babylonjs/lessons.html)!



NOTE: This is a draft site that's mostly being used for experiments -- it's not ready for public use.

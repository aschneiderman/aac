## How to Get Set up
{ For now: using Glitch. But you could also download the code off of GitHub and work on a laptop -- which would also be useful if you don't have good Internet access so you could work off-line. Or you could grab a copy of the repo and then play with it online using Visual Studio code's new online version } 

## Getting Started: Making a Simple Virtual Postcard

- explain goals, what you get to do & learn

### Your First Program
Time to get started!

- [Simple Text](../pages/lessons/0010-simple-postcard/text-hello.html)
- [Simple Postcard](../pages/lessons/0010-simple-postcard/text-postcard.html)






Variables:
- manually space spheres (maybe with the woods background?)
- NOTE: need to explain why you can't just use the word ccolor, you need to use special color
- space them by adding to a variable, x
- space them the same amount apart, by using a variable

Loops:
- instead of writing code over and over, do it in one
- using slightly fancier math (okay not that fancy): multiplication
-using fancier math: sign/cosign
- Now it's your turn: playing with this, trying out Plastic and Glass colors, trying 2 loops example


If-then:
- blocks/spheres
- Particles/fire


Animating blocks





## Functions & reusing code
- Teach this early, since reusability & breaking code into chunks are key to writing good code
- Why & how to use comments 
- How to write code you can read 6 months from now 



## Arrays 
## Basic String manipulation

## Loading assets

## Version control



## Any javascriot concepts you need to understand to do fabcier stuff in BJS.

## Onject Oriented?  Functional Programming?
- Read up on what's recommended for modern JS


## Interaction (or do later?)

#### Sample Code, Note Dumps, Etc. I Might Use in Lessons

- [Goals](../pages/lessons/goals/index.html)
- Other [Examples](../pages/examples/more-stuff.html) Of what BabylonJS can do
- 3D graphics [terminology](../pages/lessons/tutorial-3Dgraphics-terminology.html)


## Later in the course

Adding in text variables to create a "report"
- text variables: adding in how you feel today?
- Using slightly fancier math: division, integer as a scale (size) (?) Or maybe using a color range?
- Change the date and the number at the top, and you've got yourself a virtual report!

*NOTE: these aren't full-blown lessons, just beginning outlines and the code students would work with*

## How to Get Set up
- For now: using Glitch 

## Making Basic Postcards

- explain goals, what you get to do & learn

### Lesson 1: [Simple Text](../pages/lessons/100-text-hello/index.html)
- Simple commands: simpleSetup, simpleScene, simpleTextBlock (briefly explain setup, scene)[fix text blocks so pivot from front end, not back]
- Welcome to 3D: putting stuff on your postcard at X,y,z 3D location
- Adding more text blocks
- Intro to debugging & taking tiny steps, aka iteration 


### Lesson 2: Paramters/Options and Documenatation (short unit)
- Options aka parameters
  - 360 background pix
  - text options, reading simple documentation  (if your text gets cut off, play w height and length of text block)

### Lesson 3: Tricking Out Your Postcards, V1

Show some of the list of slick Simplecommands!  Maybe 2 exs that use a few commands -- eg, sky with animated airplane & text, (decide rest later -- might wanna save a few effects for loops, if then, etc units)
— Downloaded 3d images, Downloaded 3d animated objects
  - Reading a directory — for finding what 3d images, background photos, etc you have
- Changing the background color, adding a sky(?)
- Other fun commands: particles?  What else?  One or two 
- Explain simple version control: make mult copies so you can make mult postcards, try & rethink, etc
- Let people go to town! Maybe in pairs? Then show off a few results?
- Possible Quick conversation:  you’ll learn to add commands, what we call (functions/procedures?) later. What might you want to create?  (encouraging to think of themselves not just as makers but as tool makers)
- Homework: make postcards

*Q: show how to download backgrounds, images,etc?  Or have instructions and leave as part of homework extra credit?  Or put in next Lessons? Leaning toward putting it in as extra credit, then have students who did it show how  in last unit of next set of Lessons*

## Working with Basic Math, Basic String manipulation, Variables, If Then
- [what to cover?  What are fun examples?]


## Loops, Functions & reusing code
- Teach this early, since reusability & breaking code into chunks are key to writing good code
- Why & how to use comments 
- How to write code you can read 6 months from now 

## Interaction (or do later?)

## Arrays (and simething else)

## Any javascriot concepts you need to understand to do fabcier stuff in BJS.

## Onject Oriented?  Functional Programming?
- Read up on what's recommended for modern JS

#### Sample Code, Note Dumps, Etc. I Might Use in Lessons

- [Goals](../pages/lessons/goals/index.html)
- Other [Examples](../pages/examples/more-stuff.html) Of what BabylonJS can do
- 3D graphics [terminology](../pages/lessons/tutorial-3Dgraphics-terminology.html)

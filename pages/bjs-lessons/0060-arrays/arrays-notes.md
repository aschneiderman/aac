### Your First Script

- Simple commands: simpleSetup, simpleScene, simpleText (briefly explain setup, scene)
- Welcome to 3D: putting stuff on your postcard at X,y,z 3D location
- Adding more text blocks
- Intro to debugging & taking tiny steps, aka iteration 

### Creating A Virtual Postcard

- PhotoDome: straightforward enough command that we didn't create a "simple" command for it (Ask students as they go: as you are learning, what kind of commands do you think should be added to make BabylonJS easier to use -- or easier to do the specific things you want to do with BabylonJS?)
- Options aka parameters
  - text options, reading simple documentation 
    - Rotating text (need to add that option to simpleTextBlock), So you can have text behind your head that when you turn to it the text will be legible and not backwards
    -  (if your text gets cut off, play w height and length of text block)
    -  Possibly also adding in an option for the scene that rotates or moves the camera, so you start from seeing the different part of the photo?
- Now it's your turn: pick one of the following 360 background images, write some text to someone

BabylonJS is really powerful, but because it is so powerful it's also a bit overwhelming to get started. So Playful Coding uses libraries to hide a lot of the geekier stuff, so students can focus on learning the basics of computer programming.

## Principles and Assumptions Behind Postcards
- {Explain why I went with the "Simple" nomenclature. For example, I called it simpleTextBlock instead of, for ex, simpleLabel, as a little foreshadowing: that way, if they see examples on the BabylonJS playground that use TextBlock, they'll have some clue as to what's going on Close race

## Architectural/Infrastructural Decisions

### Why Jekyll?

You might wonder, given that my goal is to make it easier for teachers to be able to remix their own version, why did I use Jekyll?
- I have an RSI in both hands, so the time I can spend on this project was quite limited given that most of my voice & typing time is eaten up by work. I'm fluent in Jekyll, and I can bang out a GitHub site very quickly. But this project is only a Proof of Concept. If it ever gets turned into a real project, I might very well switch to an approach that's easier for non-geeks.
- While some BabylonJS webpages can be run just by loading them up in a browser, there's an awful lot you can't do in BabylonJS if you don't have a Web server. The fact that there isn't a standard small, super easy to use website server that works for both Windows and Macs was one more reason to go with what I know: Jekyll

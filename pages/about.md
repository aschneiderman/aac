These days, computers and phones can do a lot of cool stuff, but a lot of intro to coding classes still look like it's 1970.

There are some sites, like code.org, that take full advantage of the cool things you can do today. But unfortunately, these courses are designed
so that only a handful of developers can modify them.

Playful Coding is a proof of concept To show how we could teach coding using some of the cool things you can do with [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/), an open source JavaScript 3D engine.

BabylonJS is really powerful, but because it is so powerful it's also a bit overwhelming to get started. So Postcards uses libraries to hide a lot of the geekier stuff, so students can focus on learning the basics of computer programming.

Playful Coding is a project of [Makers All](https://makersall.org/). The first, quick and dirty version is being created by Anders Schneiderman, Makers All's director.

NOTE: this site isn't yet ready for public use -- right now it's just a place to experiment.

These days, computers and phones can do a lot of cool stuff, but a lot of beginning coding classes still look like it's 1970.

There are some sites, like code.org, that take full advantage of the cool things you can do today. But unfortunately, these courses are designed
so that only a handful of developers can modify them.

Playful Coding is a proof of concept to show  how we could:
- teach creative data visualization coding to data analyst and Excel power users who aren't coders
-  teach intro to coding using some of the cool things you can do with [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/), an open source JavaScript 3D engine.

Playful Coding is a project of [Makers All](https://makersall.org/). The first, quick and dirty version is being created by Anders Schneiderman, Makers All's director.

NOTE: this site isn't yet ready for public use -- right now it's just a place to experiment.


{ Brief desciption of ideas behind the project:
  - learn by exploring (vsas much syntax as quickly as possible)
  - Reduce cofnitive load by hiding complexity of BabylonJS -- but structure it so students know this is simplified
  - Design so more like a playlist -- try to make it easier for teachers to customize for their unique situation w/o hav(ingto reinvent everyhting from scratch
  - Eventually, design so could generate versions to be taught online -- eg, make it easy to build in GitHub and push new/updated lessons to [Glitch](https://glitch.com) -- or offline if little Net access

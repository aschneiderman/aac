I"<p>These days, computers and phones can do a lot of cool stuff, but a lot of intro to coding classes still look like it’s 1970.</p>

<p>There are some sites, like code.org, that take full advantage of the cool things you can do today. But unfortunately, these courses are designed
so that only a handful of developers can modify them.</p>

<p>Postcards is an Open source experiment to see if we can teach beginning  coding by creating digital “postcards” using some of the cool things you can do with <a href="https://www.babylonjs.com/">BabylonJS</a>, an open source JavaScript 3D engine. BabylonJS is really powerful, but because it is so powerful it’s also a bit overwhelming to get started. So Postcards uses libraries to hide a lot of the geekier stuff, so students can focus on learning the basics of computer programming.</p>

<p>NOTE: This is a draft site that’s mostly being used for experiments – it’s not ready for public use.</p>
